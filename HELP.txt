Arguments are case sensitive, except for <command>

START:
  You use this command once you have started studying.

  MESSAGE (with -m/--message flag):
    Add a message/note. Example messages would be "refactor python
    function docstrings" or "solve 5kyu codewars problems."

STOP:
  You use this command once you have stopped studying.

  MESSAGE (with -m/--message flag):
    Add a message/note. Example messages would be "finished all but
    3 TODOS" or "finally done with Dijkstra's algorithm."

UNDO:
  You use this command to undo a previous START or STOP.

EDIT:
  You use this command to edit a previous START or STOP.

  MESSAGE (with -m/--message flag):
    Replace the message/note from the previous START or STOP.

  TIME (with -t/--time flag):
    Replace the time from the previous START or STOP.
    Must be in HH:MM:SS format without AM/PM or timezone.

  MINS (with +<mins>/-<mins> flag):
    Edit the time from the previous START or STOP by adding or subtracting
    a specified number of minutes.
    <mins> must be an integer.
    -<mins> means further into the past, while +<mins> means closer to the
    present or farther into the future.
    For example, if the previous time was 11:30:00, +5 would edit it to
    11:35:00, and -5 to 11:25:00.

VIEW:
  You use this command to view the times and stats of
  your logged time.

  FROM (POSITIVE INTEGER || UNDERSCORE -> DAYS):
    Optional integer argument that can be used in
    combination with the VIEW command. It uses the past
    N days in its display of times and stats if supplied,
    if not provided or is an underscore it shows the times
    and stats for all time.

    TO (NON-NEGATIVE INTEGER -> DAYS):
      Optional and can be used with FROM. If supplied, VIEW
      will only show info from 'FROM days ago' to 'TO days ago'.
      For example, if FROM and TO are provided and have values of
      6 and 3, then data from 6 days ago to 3 days ago will be displayed.
      If not provided, then TO defaults to 0.
